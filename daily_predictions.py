# TODO Fix the UTC timezone problems in the github actions scheduling
# TODO Add prediction of 3, 7 days, to give more context
# TODO Based upon the overpay of the other users, calculate a max price to pay for a player
# TODO Add features like starting 11 probability, injuries, ...
# TODO Improve budget calculation, weird bug that for me the budgets is 513929 off, idk why, checked everything
